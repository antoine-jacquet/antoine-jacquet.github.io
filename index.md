## About me

I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Economics department at [Sciences Po](https://www.tse-fr.eu), in the ERC team [EQUIPRICE](http://alfredgalichon.com/equiprice/). 
I am an applied microeconomist with interests at the intersection of Labor and Demographic economics and Cultural economics.

<!--
In my [research](.\research.html), I am broadly interested in how culture interacts with economic incentives and outcomes, with the aim to understand how policies differentially affect cultural minorities.
To study this, I use microeconomic theory and empirical methods, in particular structural econometrics.
-->

I obtained my PhD from the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu). Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in mathematics and economics at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu), and obtained a MSc in Quantitative Economic History from the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk).
From 2017 to 2020 I was affiliated with the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse](https://www.iast.fr).
<!--
During the winter 2022 I was visiting scholar at the Economics department at [Columbia University](https://econ.columbia.edu).
