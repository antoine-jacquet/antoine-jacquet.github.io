## About me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu).  
In my [research](research.html), I am broadly interested in how culture interacts with economic incentives and outcomes, as well as in the resulting population dynamics.
To study this, I use microeconomic theory, matching models, and their estimation using structural econometrics.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in mathematics and economics at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu), and obtained a MSc in Quantitative Economic History from the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk). From 2017 to 2020 I was affiliated with the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse](https://www.iast.fr).

You can find my resume [here](assets/images/CV_AJacquet.pdf).  

I am visiting Columbia University for the Spring 2022 semester.
