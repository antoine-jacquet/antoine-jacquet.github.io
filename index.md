## About me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu).  
In my research, I am broadly interested in how culture interacts with economic incentives and outcomes.
To do this, I use microeconomic theory, matching models, and econometrics.

Previously, I studied at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.tse-fr.eu) and the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk), and I was a doctoral fellow at the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse](https://www.iast.fr).

You can find my resume [here](assets/images/CV_AJacquet.pdf).  

I am visiting Columbia University for the Spring 2022 semester.
