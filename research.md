What economic sacrifices are people willing to make to transmit their culture?
Using data on religious affiliation in France, I study the intergenerational transmission of religion and how it interacts with children's educational outcomes.
A reduced-form analysis suggests that mothers contribute to religious transmission more than fathers; religious minorities more than majorities; and lower-educated parents more than higher-educated ones.
A mechanism that can explain these patterns is that higher-educated parents have a higher opportunity cost of transmitting their religion to their children.
I investigate this mechanism through a structural model, in which parents endogenously decide their time investments in their child's culture on the one hand, and in their formal education on the other hand.
The analysis suggests that heterogeneities in transmission patterns are driven primarily by heterogeneities in preferences for religious transmission across genders and religious groups, rather than by differences in parents' education.
Furthermore, religious minorities pay a higher price for religious transmission in terms of their children's educational outcomes.
For instance, by measuring this cost in terms of the probability that the child will obtain a college education, Muslim parents pay a cost between 8 and 13 times greater than that for Christians.

    <b> Veiling and the economic integration of Muslim women in France </b> <br />

    <p>
Veiling among Muslim women is a cultural practice which has been at the center of public debates in Western countries for a few decades, but is still poorly understood.
Using unique confidential survey data over the largest sample of Muslim women in France, we unpack the various motives behind veiling behavior.
Grounded in an economic theory of veiling, our analysis shows that veiling is very costly in terms of economic integration.
We find that women reporting to always wear a conspicuous religious symbol are significantly less likely to be economically active.
Our results suggest that women are willing to adopt such a costly identity trait mostly for private motives rather than because of pressure from the community.
As such, our results question the rhetoric often used to justify policies restricting the wearing of religious symbols in France.
Additional results suggest that wearing discreet religious symbols might act as a strategy to mitigate the economic penalty of the veil while allowing women to preserve religious benefits.

The economic implications of policies limiting the wearing of the Islamic veil for Muslim women in Western countries are still poorly understood.
This paper investigates the relationship between veiling behavior and economic participation using the largest sample of Muslim women in France.
Firstly, we present new descriptive evidence about Muslim women in France.
We demonstrate a significant negative relationship between veiling and economic participation, which contrasts with the existing economic theory of veiling in Muslim-majority countries.
Secondly, we extend this theory by including elements relevant to the Muslim-minority context, such as potentially-reduced economic opportunities for veiled women.
In so doing, we are able to rationalize the contrast between the Muslim-majority and Muslim-minority contexts.
Thirdly, we develop and estimate a discrete-choice model of veiling and labor force participation to disentangle the various motivations behind the joint decision to veil and to be economically active.
Our findings indicate that veiled women are less economically active not due to religious preferences, but rather because the benefits of economic participation are lower for women who veil compared to those who do not.
This result echoes previous findings in the literature regarding labor market discrimination against individuals who signal their religious affiliation.
Additionally, our results emphasize the significance of personal religious motives in the decision to veil, rather than community-based religious pressure.
This calls into question the rhetoric used to justify policies that restrict the wearing of religious symbols in France.

    <b> A unifying framework for the stable coexistence of cultural traits </b>
    <details> <summary> Abstract </summary>
    <p>
    I use the canonical evolutionary model of frequency-dependent selection to develop a unifying framework for the stable coexistence of cultural traits. First, I derive general theoretical results on population dynamics for some common cases, such as random matching or linear assortative matching. In a second step, I consider several examples from the economics and biology literatures, which document and provide reasons for the stable coexistence of cultural traits. I show that these examples can be seen as particular applications of the unifying framework that I propose. Such applications provide natural extensions to the baseline framework, and illustrate its flexibility.
