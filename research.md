    <p>
I present a new model of cultural transmission, in which children are simultaneously socialized to several cultural traits through parental time investments as well as their environment.
Using parents–children data on religious affiliation in France, I then analyse the model in reduced form to examine the patterns of intergenerational religious transmission, finding that mothers contribute more to religious transmission to children than fathers; religious minorities more than majorities; and lower-educated parents more than higher-educated ones.
To explain this pattern, I embed the cultural transmission model in a collective household problem, in which parents endogenously decide their time investments in their child's culture on one side, and in their formal education on the other side.
I verify that the model's predictions replicates the stylized facts in the data.
Finally, I estimate this model, finding that a systematic difference in preferences across religions and genders is the main factor explaining disparities in transmission patterns, as opposed to an argument of comparative advantage in human capital transmission for higher-educated individuals.

    <p>
    We investigate both theoretically and empirically the determinants of veiling among Muslim women in France, and we explore the relationship between veiling and economic participation in this population. To do so, we develop an extension of Carvalho’s economic theory of veiling. Motivated by empirical observations in the literature in social sciences, we introduce an additional motive for veiling to the existing theory. Namely, we distinguish the perception of the Islamic veil by the French secular society to that of the woman’s close community. We empirically test the predictions of this theoretical model using rich French data containing unique information on religion and religiosity. Finally, this study aims at bringing a new perspective on the potential consequences of secular policies in France.

    <b> A unifying framework for the stable coexistence of cultural traits </b>
    <details> <summary> Abstract </summary>
    <p>
    I use the canonical evolutionary model of frequency-dependent selection to develop a unifying framework for the stable coexistence of cultural traits. First, I derive general theoretical results on population dynamics for some common cases, such as random matching or linear assortative matching. In a second step, I consider several examples from the economics and biology literatures, which document and provide reasons for the stable coexistence of cultural traits. I show that these examples can be seen as particular applications of the unifying framework that I propose. Such applications provide natural extensions to the baseline framework, and illustrate its flexibility.
