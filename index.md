## About me

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu).  
In my [research](.\research.html), I am broadly interested in how culture interacts with economic incentives and outcomes, as well as in the resulting population dynamics.
To study this, I use microeconomic theory, matching models, and their estimation using structural econometrics.

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in mathematics and economics at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu), and obtained a MSc in Quantitative Economic History from the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk).
From 2017 to 2020 I was affiliated with the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse](https://www.iast.fr).
During the winter 2022 I was a visiting scholar at the Economics department at [Columbia University](https://econ.columbia.edu).

<b>You can find my resume [here](assets/CV_AJacquet.pdf) and my job market paper [here](assets/JMP_AJacquet.pdf).</b>  

I will be available for interviews at the 2022–2023 EEA and ASSA meetings.
