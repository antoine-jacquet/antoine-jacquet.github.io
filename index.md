## About me

I am a post-doctoral researcher in the Economics department at [Sciences Po](https://www.sciencespo.fr/department-economics/en.html), part of the ERC team [EQUIPRICE](http://alfredgalichon.com/equiprice/). 

My research spans both theoretical and applied aspects of matching models.
On the theoretical side, I leverage tools from microeconomics, game theory, structural econometrics, and computational methods to investigate properties of existing models and propose new frameworks.
On the applied side, I examine how matching shapes outcomes in several real-life matching markets, including housing, marriage, and labor markets.

<!--
I am an applied microeconomist with interests at the intersection of Labor and Demographic economics and Cultural economics.

<!--
In my [research](.\research.html), I am broadly interested in how culture interacts with economic incentives and outcomes, with the aim to understand how policies differentially affect cultural minorities.
To study this, I use microeconomic theory and empirical methods, in particular structural econometrics.

I obtained my PhD from the [Toulouse School of Economics](https://www.tse-fr.eu) in 2023. Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies in mathematics and economics at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu), and obtained a MSc in Quantitative Economic History from the [London School of Economics](https://www.lse.ac.uk).
From 2017 to 2020 I was affiliated with the [Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse](https://www.iast.fr).
<!--
During the winter 2022 I was visiting scholar at the Economics department at [Columbia University](https://econ.columbia.edu).
