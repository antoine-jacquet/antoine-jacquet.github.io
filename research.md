    <p>
I present a new model of cultural transmission, in which children are simultaneously socialized to several cultural traits through parental time investments as well as their environment.
Using parents–children data on religious affiliation in France, I then analyse the model in reduced form to examine the patterns of intergenerational religious transmission, finding that mothers contribute more to religious transmission to children than fathers; religious minorities more than majorities; and lower-educated parents more than higher-educated ones.
To explain this pattern, I embed the cultural transmission model in a collective household problem, in which parents endogenously decide their time investments in their child's culture on one side, and in their formal education on the other side.
I verify that the model's predictions replicates the stylized facts in the data.
Finally, I estimate this model, finding that a systematic difference in preferences across religions and genders is the main factor explaining disparities in transmission patterns, as opposed to an argument of comparative advantage in human capital transmission for higher-educated individuals.

    <b> Veiling and economic participation of Muslim women in France </b> <br />
    (with Sébastien Montpetit)
    <details> <summary> Abstract </summary>
    <p>
Veiling among Muslim women is a cultural practice which has been at the center of public debates in Western countries for a few decades, but is still poorly understood.
Using unique confidential survey data over the largest sample of Muslim women in France, we unpack the various motives behind veiling behavior.
Grounded in economic theory of veiling, our analysis shows that veiling is very costly in terms of economic integration.
We find that women reporting to always wear a conspicuous religious symbol are significantly less likely to be economically active.
Our results suggest that women are willing to adopt such a costly identity trait mostly for private motives rather than because of pressure from the community.
As such, our results question the rhetoric often used to justify policies restricting the wearing of religious symbols in France.
Additional results suggest that wearing discreet religious symbols might act as a strategy to mitigate the economic penalty of the veil while allowing women to preserve religious benefits.

    <b> A unifying framework for the stable coexistence of cultural traits </b>
    <details> <summary> Abstract </summary>
    <p>
    I use the canonical evolutionary model of frequency-dependent selection to develop a unifying framework for the stable coexistence of cultural traits. First, I derive general theoretical results on population dynamics for some common cases, such as random matching or linear assortative matching. In a second step, I consider several examples from the economics and biology literatures, which document and provide reasons for the stable coexistence of cultural traits. I show that these examples can be seen as particular applications of the unifying framework that I propose. Such applications provide natural extensions to the baseline framework, and illustrate its flexibility.
